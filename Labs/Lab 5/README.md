Generate a wailing audio siren using a Inter-IC Sound (I2S) DAC with a speaker or headphone connected to port JA.

**More Information:** https://github.com/kevinwlu/dsd/tree/master/Nexys-A7/Lab-5

## Original
Generates wailing triangle wave at specific pitch range and wailing speed.

## Modifications
Modified source and constraint files include code additions that allow for the following changes:
- Allow user to press BTNU to create a square wave instead of triangular wave
- Allow user to control wailing speed by using switches 0-7 to generate a number related to the speed (All off -> 0 Speed, All on -> Fast speed)
